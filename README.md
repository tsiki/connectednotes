# Connected Notes

A note taking app based on Zettelkasten.

Take notes. Connect notes. Graph connections.

# Goals

- A modern take on Zettelkasten
- Progressive web app usable from both mobile and desktop
- Give users as much control over their notes as possible
  - Notes are mainly synced in (insert users favorite cloud service here) with firebase app for trying out/demos
- Markdown based (maybe provide WYSIWYG editor as alternative?)
- Graph view for exploring notes easily
- Open source (duh)

# Current progress

I expect to get a pre-alpha version out at the end of May. Current major missing features are integration with cloud services and prettier UI.
